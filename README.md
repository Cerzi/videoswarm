# 🐝 Video Swarm

A desktop Electron application for viewing hundreds of videos simultaneously. Perfect for managing large video collections with advanced masonry layouts, real-time playback, and instant file system monitoring.

> **See your entire video collection in motion** - when static thumbnails aren't enough, Video Swarm shows you everything at once.

## 🎯 Perfect For Video Workflows

### 🤖 **AI Video Generation Tools**
- **Load your entire ComfyUI output folder recursively and browse all of your Wan/Hunyuan/etc generations in motion**
- **Hundreds of I2V generations from the same starting image? Image thumbnails are useless - Video Swarm is the answer**

### 📁 **Large Video Collections**
- **Content libraries**: Browse B-roll, stock footage, and asset collections
- **Archive management**: Navigate thousands of videos with ease
- **Batch processing**: Review video outputs from any bulk generation tool
- **Research datasets**: Analyze large video collections for patterns and content

### 🔍 **Why Video Swarm?**
Traditional file browsers show only static thumbnails, making it impossible to understand the content and motion of your videos. Video Swarm solves this by:
- Playing all videos simultaneously so you can see motion and content at a glance
- Smart batch organization for large video generation sessions
- Instant visual comparison between different outputs and variations
- Efficient workflow for selecting the best videos from hundreds of files
